# AwesomeWM Based Debian Configuration
I like awesomeWM and am not really a fan of removing all the OpenOffice binaries
from my tiny little SSD. Since I'm re-starting fireaxe I'm trying to get as much
of the base configuration in this as possible, less security testing stuff and
anything in a non-Debian and or Devuan repository.

Uses Debian Stretch as a basis, with backports.

To build, simply

        make all

If you need non-free firmware, use

        make nonfree
